# Aerospace OUTR website

Official Website of Aerospace Club of OUTR

## Development

For the website we are currently using python with django library as a backend and normal HTML + CSS for frontend.

If you want to contribute you can follow the following steps for creating a development environment in your system.

Assuming python is already installed in your PC (Check [python website for dwonloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

It is reccomanded to create a virtual environment for this project but necessary.

Now after cloning the repository you can install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirments.txt
```

Now you can run the development server using

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

If you have any queries you can create an issue on github.
