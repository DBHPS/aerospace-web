                <p>We succesfully made a fully funtional RC plane (after 4 crashes) and a Model Rocket with Parachute
                    ejection mechanism which was successfully showcased at SPACE DEFENCE EXPO at VSSUT Burla along with
                    a 3rd eye- an ancillary drone for the fighter aircraft with advance radar jamming technology.
                    Apart from these, we have tied up with Star Laboratories Surat who guide us for various projects and
                    conduct various programmes.
